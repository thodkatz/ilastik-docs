	abstract = {The remarkable performance of Convolutional Neural Networks on image segmentation tasks comes at the cost of a large amount of pixelwise annotated images that have to be segmented for training. In contrast, feature-based learning methods, such as the Random Forest, require little training data, but never reach the segmentation accuracy of CNNs. This work bridges the two approaches in a transfer learning setting. We show that a CNN can be trained to correct the errors of the Random Forest in the source domain and then be applied to correct such errors in the target domain without retraining, as the domain shift between the Random Forest predictions is much smaller than between the raw data. By leveraging a few brushstrokes as annotations in the target domain, the method can deliver segmentations that are sufficiently accurate to act as pseudo-labels for target-domain CNN training. We demonstrate the performance of the method on several datasets with the challenging tasks of mitochondria, membrane and nuclear segmentation. It yields excellent performance compared to microscopy domain adaptation baselines, especially when a significant domain shift is involved.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

  abstract = {Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers—8× deeper than VGG nets [41] but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers.},

  abstract = {There is large consent that successful training of deep networks requires many thousand annotated training samples. In this paper, we present a network and training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use the available annotated samples more efficiently. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU. The full implementation (based on Caffe) and the trained networks are available at http://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/ronneber/u-net.},
